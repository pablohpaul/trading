# trading
This is my first lines of algorithmic trading. I try to replicate a model that I read in a book. 
These are only my first steps. The file named trading_algoritmico.R contains several functions that gives buy or sell signals. The user must buy/sell manually in its broker. 
The signals are given by EMA Cross and Stochastic. The EMA is calculated for every ticker in particular, looking for the better historical combination of fast and slow EMA. 
The book where I took the ideas can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Alejandro-Daniel-Romero-Maidana-ebook/dp/B01M6YX5ZU/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=alejandro+romero+maidana&qid=1601152626&sr=8-1)
